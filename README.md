# TRAFFIC-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM-USING-C++-
The Traffic Management System is a C++ program that simulates traffic signal operations and provides a user-interactive mechanism for controlling traffic flow. It features a normal mode with a RED → YELLOW → GREEN signal sequence and an emergency mode that prioritizes emergency vehicles by directly switching to GREEN. The system utilizes multithreading to handle signal delays and signal handling (SIGINT) to allow graceful termination when interrupted (e.g., via Ctrl+C). This project serves as a foundation for real-world traffic regulation and can be expanded with IoT integration for automated traffic control.
